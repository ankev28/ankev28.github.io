        Hi there! Welcome to my first post. This blog serves mainly just to
        document the process of my website's development, some stuff that
        I come up with on the spot, or something I think is worthwhile noting.
        A friend of mine actually made his own website recently and hosted
        online which inspired me to make this site too, although this is my
        first attempt at anything web dev related so forgive me if I'm noob
        or there's anything convention-wise that I'm missing cuz I'm pretty
        inexperienced I'd say.
        ;-;
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        To start off, I would like to thank <a href="https://freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp.org</a>
        for a ton of help. There's actually so much information to be found online
        that entails how to get started on like any subject, so shoutout to these sources
        for keeping things easy to understand! Other places like
        <a href="https://udemy.com">Udemy</a> or <a href="https://coursera.org">Coursera</a>
        are probably good too, I just didn't use them for learning how to make
        this site so far. Also, just cuz I suck at web dev so far doesn't mean
        freeCodeCamp sucks as a resource or anything, my skills don't reflect on
        the freeCodeCamp's quality since I'm still just a beginner at all this.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Anyways, you're probably wondering: "Why make a website Kevin? You don't seem
        to be the type of guy to do frontend work." And you'd be correct üôÇ, but the
        thing is it's important to keep learning stuff as you drift along on this big
        wet rock in the middle of nowhere in outer space. I definitely know I had 0
        background in anything web related coming into this, but I thought it would be
        a good change of pace to learn something like this for winter break, since we
        get a month off and I'm trying to see some fun stuff I can do and actually deliver
        to you, the reader ‚ù§. Also, like my friend demonstrated himself, it's just good
        practice to keep track of stuff in your life as well as to share a slice of an
        experience at that time so I can look back on and say something like "yeah, I did
        do that and it was epic üòé". I also hope you guys will enjoy reading about
        the stuff that I record üôÇ.
