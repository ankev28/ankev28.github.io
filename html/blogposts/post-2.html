            <p class="paragraph">
              Alright, to start off, osu! is a free to play rythm game made by Dean "Peppy" Herbert (if you haven't heard of him,
              he's one of the most active Github users as seen <a href="https://github.com/peppy">here</a>). The game was
              released in 2007, so it's a pretty longstanding game, and was made with C#. The whole project is on Peppy's Github,
              actually, which I think is pretty neat, and it's updated pretty frequently for things like bug fixes. It's probably
              the only computer game I play at the moment, and it's something that I think reflects a lot to life in general,
              despite being "only a game", as my parents would put it. It's really fun, though, I would wholly recommend it. To
              play on a computer, you need some tracking device (ie. a tablet or mouse) and a keyboard/pad for tapping. There are
              other devices you can play on, like osu!lazer has a version for mobile devices, but I haven't gotten around to trying
              it yet to say how good it is but I trust peppy made it fun ðŸ™‚.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              There's a whole community behind osu! that probably no one's ever heard of until you're actually in the
              community yourself lol. I didn't know anything about the game, who played it, etc., until I found a recommended
              YouTube clip of <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/124493">Cookiezi</a>, one of the all time greats who was well
              beyond his time, playing a map called "Magnolia" that was mapped by AngelHoney. I thought it was the coolest
              thing ever, you know, like I was gonna be the next Cookiezi, get all the performance points, and be a boss in the
              osu! world. That never happened, of course, since Cookiezi is a once in a lifetime player. Then again, there's
              only one of me, as well ðŸ˜Ž. Soon enough, I got pretty immersed in osu! culture, it's pretty infectious with how
              entertaining like 70% of the stuff is that goes on in the game.

          <h2 class="par-head">OK, So What's the Big Deal?</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Ok, ok, yeah, you probably want to know why I think osu! is worthy of its own blog post. And so I will
              reflect on it here ðŸ™‚. osu! is like a big magnifying glass for rage, and what I mean by that is
              a lot of frustration, insecurity (idk you name it), gets poured into this game because of how simple the
              game is. It's a game where you click circles to the beat of some song, and the best advice anyone can
              give is "play more". When you have an off day, it's like an attack on your skills as a player, and it
              just sucks to underperform in any aspect of life, let alone a game. If you've never gotten emotional or
              mad while playing a game, you've never been passionate about them before. Like, picture not being able
              to do something as well as you could a week ago, or seeing no improvement for a long period of time.
              osu! is pretty much a grind all the time to get better at the game skillwise, but it's both a fun and
              infuriating grind sometimes.

          <h2 class="par-head">Key Takeaways</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
              In spite of all I said about osu! being rage inducing, osu! has taught me (or I taught myself technically
              by playing osu!) things like keeping my frustration and nerves in check, surprisingly, in real life. It's
              easy to get lost in the moment when you're tilted and playing bad, and it's important to just take a step
              back and look at the progress you've made up until then. There's no such thing as only good days happening,
              or else those good days are only average in retrospect. Tilting is perfectly natural, albeit very frustrating
              and makes you want to destroy your keyboard sometimes, but it's what keeps those good days special, you know?
              And I feel like osu! helped with understanding that, especially because it's a computer game and easier to see
              the full scope of compared to something in real life that might have actual consequences. I wouldn't say I'm
              particularly good at the game, but I've been playing for a while and the improvement is definitely there from
              when I first started out as a complete noob - just as the wise man once said: "The thousand mile journey begins
              with a single step". I guess sometimes in osu! you take like 5 steps back sometimes, but one thing I've learned
              is that you will make progress towards your end goal so long as you don't give up on it. Keep your head up ðŸ™‚!
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Regardless of whichever game you play, make sure to enjoy the journey. You never know what you might gain
              from something until you take a deep breath!
